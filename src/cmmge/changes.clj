;;We can think of music as series of changes over time.
;;These can be "fine" changes within a melody, or with a larger contect, changes to song
;;structure for example.

;;more thoughts:,

;;If a sound has too many changes, the listener cannot keep track of what is happening,
;;and even if it's organized, if the listener can't organize it, subconsiously or consiously,
;;it will just sound like noise. But if a sound doesn't have enough changes, it sound simple,
;;and isn't engaging to listen to.


;;Is popular music dull because the songs themselves are simple, or are they more formulaic,
;;so people have a better idea of what to expect?

;;Things that affect complexity:
;; instrument count
;; syncopation
;; melodic / harmonic divergence from the key
;;like with modes, if you are in the key of c major, throwing in an f# isn't as
;;much of a divergence as a d#
